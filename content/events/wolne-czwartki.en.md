Thursdays Off is a weekly, free event to which we invite young people, who have experienced migration, but not only. We meet at 5 PM at Inclsv Buzz at Zbawiciela Square. We have a base and free time on our hands, what happens next depends on the weather and on what we want to do. On sunny days, we will offer you trips and games in the open air: bicycles, walks, Frisbee, bonfires. Inside, we can watch movies, play games, paint nails, make pottery - we will see! Our meetings are a chance to practice Polish and other languages ​​during casual conversations, get to know the city and make new friends.
 
We invite everyone - regardless of skin color, sexual orientation, religion or belonging to any minority group - to feel at home. Come and stay with us.
