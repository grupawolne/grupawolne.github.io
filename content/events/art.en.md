Art course with elements of art therapy. We want to create a safe space where you can express yourself, try, explore, make "mistakes" and be creative. The most important thing for us is the process, not the end result, therefore we invite participants to take part in the entire course, not just individual classes. We will adapt the program of classes to your needs and interests. We invite both people who want to draw and paint for pure pleasure and those who want to apply for art studies and need to prepare a portfolio.
