As Grupa Wolne we would like to invite you to work together on a zine. From the 9th of September until the end of December we are going to meet every friday evening in Baza Inclsv in order to learn certain aspects of group work and editorial activities - in practice! At the same time, we are announcing an open call for the works from which we will create the first issue of our paper. The printed zine will be distributed in Warsaw, it will also be published on the Internet.

We would like to invite all of you who like to read, edit, submit, think creatively and act on practical issues. We just as cordially invite those who do not know if they like those activities yet, but would like to give it a shot.

Get in touch: zinukraine@grupawolne.pl
